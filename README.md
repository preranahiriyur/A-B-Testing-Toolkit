# A-B-Testing-Toolkit

This repository contains my notes (from courses and readings) on A/B testing as well as a toolkit I am working on using RShiny. 

Check out my Sample Size and Significance Level Calculator by running - runGitHub( "A-B-Testing-Toolkit", "preranahiriyur") - on RStudio. I am working on adding more features to the app soon!
